# Implementing a Recommender System on Spark
<a href="#top"> Back To Top </a>  
  
In our previous assignment, we experimented with accuracy measures and incorporated serendipity into our recommender system. The dataset we used for that assignment - in its original form - had appoximately 1.5 mil ratings, which we in turn scaled down considerably.  
  
In this assignment, we will attempt to use the full dataset using Spark, then compare the performance to the model we built in project 4 using the scaled down dataset.  
  
```{r load_data}
# dataset of ratings
training_raw <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsvmelo/Data612-Summer-2020/master/Project_4/training_subset.csv") %>% data.frame()
ratings_raw<- select(training_raw, 1:3)
```  
  
## Move Dataframe to Spark 
<a href="#top"> Back To Top </a>
  
Once the dataframe was created on the local disk, we connected to Spark and copied it to a Spark dataframe:  
  
```{r sprkload}
# install Spark
spark_install(version = "2.4", hadoop_version = "2.7")
# create connection to Spark
sc <- spark_connect(master = "local")  
# move local disk dataframe to Spark; had to split into 10 commands
ratingsSprk <- sdf_copy_to(sc, ratings_raw, "ratings_sprk", overwrite = TRUE)
```  
  
## Create Recommender Model in Spark  
<a href="#top"> Back To Top </a>
  
After loading the data frame to Spark, we built a recommender system using the `ml_als` function available in `sparklyr`, which builds collaborative filtering models using Alternating Least Squares (ALS).  

We then used that model to make predictions and compiled accuracy metrics. In a later section, we will compare these metrics to the same metrics generated by running the model exactly as we had in Project 4.  
  
```{r sprkmdl}
# create Spark recommender model
partitions <- ratingsSprk %>% sdf_random_split(training = 0.8, test = 0.2, seed = 137)
spark_mdl <- ml_als(partitions$training, rating ~ userId + movieId,rating_col = "rating", user_col = "userId", item_col = "movieId", cold_start_strategy = "drop")
summary(spark_mdl)
# predictions
sparkPredict <- ml_predict(spark_mdl,partitions$test)
# create recommendation
sparkRec <- ml_recommend(spark_mdl, type = c("items", "users"), n = 10)
# check accuracy
rmse <- ml_regression_evaluator(sparkPredict, metric_name = "rmse")
mae <- ml_regression_evaluator(sparkPredict, metric_name = "mae")
mse <- ml_regression_evaluator(sparkPredict, metric_name = "mse")
als_spark<-c(rmse, mse, mae)
# disconnect
spark_disconnect(sc)
```
  
## Compare to Results from Project 4 Dataset
<a href="#top"> Back To Top </a>
  
In the section below, we recreate the model and generate predictions just as we had in Project 4:  
  
```{r rm}
# coercing into realRatingMatrix
t <- distinct(ratings_raw)
ratings <- as(t, "realRatingMatrix")
# Subsetting training set with movies that have been rated more than 200 times
ratings1 <- ratings[,colCounts(ratings) > 200]
# create evaluation scheme
eval_sets <- evaluationScheme(data = ratings1, method = "cross-validation", k = 4, given = 5, goodRating = 3)
# build UBCF model and SVD model
ubcf_rec <- Recommender(getData(eval_sets, "train"), "UBCF", param = list(normalize = "center", method = "cosine"))
svd_rec <- Recommender(getData(eval_sets, "train"), "SVD", param = list(normalize = "center", k = 10))
# Make predictions with each model
ubcf_pred <- predict(ubcf_rec, getData(eval_sets, "known"), type = "ratings")
svd_pred <- predict(svd_rec, getData(eval_sets, "known"), type = "ratings")
```  
  
<br>

## Compare the UBCF and SVD Recommender Models to Spark Model
<a href="#top"> Back To Top </a>  
  
Now we can compare the results from the ALS model built using Spark with the UBCF and SVD models we created in Project 4:  
  
```{r err}
# Table showing error calcs for UBCF vs SVD
ubcf_er <- calcPredictionAccuracy(ubcf_pred, getData(eval_sets, "unknown"))
svd_er <- calcPredictionAccuracy(svd_pred, getData(eval_sets, "unknown"))
# RMSE, MSE and MAE
k_Method <- c("ALS","UBCF-Cosine","SVD")
k_table_p <- data.frame(rbind(als_spark,ubcf_er, svd_er)) 
rownames(k_table_p) <- k_Method
k_table_p <- k_table_p[order(k_table_p$RMSE ),]
kable(k_table_p) %>% kable_styling()
```   
  
As can be seen the RMSE, MSE and MAE are better for the ALS model than the UBCF or SVD models.
